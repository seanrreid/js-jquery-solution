# jQuery to JS

This is an older application written using a JavaScript framework called [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

You're mission is to refactor this and _remove_ the dependency on jQuery. Change all the methods to use plain ol'JS.

This message won't self-destruct...b/c this isn't _Mission Impossible_.
